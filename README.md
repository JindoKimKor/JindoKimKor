## Portfolio

> **94.88% CI/CD Infrastructure Cost Reduction**
> <details>
> <summary>View details</summary>
>
> - **Context:** Unity CI/CD build environment isolation at VARLab
> - **Problem:** Unity Editor 100% CPU usage → server crashes on concurrent builds
> - **Solution:** Azure Batch + Spot VMs for on-demand execution
> - **Result:** 94.88% cost reduction ($618 → $32 for 56 days)
> - **Keywords:** Azure Batch, Spot VMs, Docker, Unity, Cost Optimization
> - [Documentation](https://github.com/JindoKimKor/Self-Binnacle/blob/main/Voyages/Projects/VARLab-work-transfer/portfolios/devops-jenkins-linux/94.88-percent-cost-reduction/README.md)

> **Retrospective Analysis: From 5 Monolithic Pipelines to 4-Layer Architecture**
> <details>
> <summary>View details</summary>
>
> - **What I did:** Transformed 5 monolithic pipelines (37% duplication) into 4-layer architecture with centralized libraries
> - **How it emerged:** Felt the pain → organized by domain naturally → patterns emerged
> - **Post-analysis:** Mapped my solution to industry concepts (Software Smells, DDD patterns, GoF Design Patterns)
> - **Documentation:** Problem analysis, pattern identification, architecture rationale
> - [Analysis Document](https://jindokimkor.github.io/Self-Binnacle/)

> **Led Team's First Successful SDLC**
> <details>
> <summary>View details</summary>
>
> - **Context:** Part-time startup team, no development process, limited real-time communication
> - **Problem:** No requirements-to-code workflow, isolated dev environment, no CI/CD feedback loop
> - **Solution:** Unified Feature Specification for cross-functional workflow, GitHub Ruleset + AWS CodePipeline for code-to-staging infrastructure
> - **Keywords:** SDLC, Feature Specification, GitHub Ruleset, AWS IAM, CodePipeline, Django
> - [Documentation](https://github.com/JindoKimKor/Self-Binnacle/blob/main/Voyages/Projects/Helprr.ai/README.md)

> **Stabilized Crashed Unity Build Server**
> <details>
> <summary>View details</summary>
>
> - **Context:** Unity CI/CD server stability crisis (June 2024)
> - **Problem:** VM crashes when 2-3 pipelines run simultaneously
> - **Solution:** Trade-off approach - shared project files + optimization skip
> - **Result:** Server stabilized, concurrent pipelines supported
> - **Byproduct:** 80% faster builds, 90% CPU reduction
> - [Documentation](https://github.com/JindoKimKor/Self-Binnacle/blob/main/Voyages/Projects/VARLab-work-transfer/portfolios/devops-jenkins-windows/stabilized-crashed-build-server/README.md)
